Node API Optimizer

Overview
Node API Optimizer leverages the power of Node.js, TypeScript, and Sequelize to deliver scalable and efficient APIs. By optimizing data queries and streamlining API routes, this project aims to increase request handling efficiency and reduce response times, ensuring rapid and reliable data management for high-demand applications.

Features
Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle high traffic efficiently.
Optimized Queries: Improved database query performance with Sequelize.
Caching: Utilizes Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
Efficient Routing: Streamlined API routes for faster response times.
TypeScript: Provides type safety and improved code quality.
Testing: Comprehensive tests to ensure reliability and performance.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (v6 or higher)
SQLite (for development)
Redis (for caching)
Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Anshuman314/Node-API-Optimizer.git
cd Node-API-Optimizer/Sample_Project

Install dependencies:
npm install

Setup the database:
The project uses SQLite for simplicity. The database file database.sqlite is already included.

Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:database.sqlite
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

Running the Application
Start the development server:
npm start

Access the API:
The API will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Running Tests
Run all tests:
npm test

Usage Examples
Example 1: Fetch Users with Optimized Queries
Before Optimization:
const users = await User.findAll({
  include: [
    { model: Profile, include: [Address] },
    { model: Orders, include: [OrderItems] }
  ]
});
After Optimization:
const users = await User.findAll({
  attributes: ['id', 'name'],
  include: [
    { model: Profile, attributes: ['bio', 'userId'] }
  ]
});

const userIds = users.map(user => user.id);

const orders = await Order.findAll({
  where: { userId: userIds },
  include: [{ model: OrderItems, attributes: ['productId', 'quantity'] }]
});
Example 2: Caching Frequently Accessed Data
Before Optimization:
const getProducts = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const products = await Product.findAll();
  res.json(products);
};
After Optimization:
import Redis from 'ioredis';

const redis = new Redis();

const getProducts = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const cacheKey = 'products';
  const cachedProducts = await redis.get(cacheKey);

  if (cachedProducts) {
    return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedProducts));
  }

  const products = await Product.findAll();
  await redis.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(products), 'EX', 3600); // Cache for 1 hour

  res.json(products);
};
